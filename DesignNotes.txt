Map Creation -- 1 Nov 2012

Thoughts on how to represent ponential contents of a Tile object during map construction. Utilizing 4 bits per object (Terrain, Effect, and Entity) will leave us with 15 possible types of each and an additional 4 bits on the high end for future expansion.

Using a char will give us two bytes.

bits 	0-3		4-7		8-11		12-15

type	terrain		effect		entity		future expansion
