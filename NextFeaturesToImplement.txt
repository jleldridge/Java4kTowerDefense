-Free player and mobs from specific slots on the grid
-Implement a projectile spell, an area effect spell, a field spell, and "rune"
  type spells
-Implement terrain checks in main loop.
*-Create a map builder
*-Remove "Entity" from the tiles
    Why specifically do we want to remove entities from the tile objects? Is this because we want to be able to have multiple entities on a given tile. In which case we could make an array list of of entities for the tiles. Otherwise, we need to redo some of the stuff in the engine. 
-Create some "effects" for tiles
*-create some mobs
    I've added a bat, goblin, and blob for the time being. I was thinking, should we add an 'isFlying' boolean for entities? Could make for some interesting game dynamics in the future.
